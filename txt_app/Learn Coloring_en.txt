Learn Coloring is a fun and educational app that allows you to explore your creativity and improve your coloring skills. With two fill and paint modes, you can choose between a simple fill mode that fills in large areas with a single color, or a more detailed paint mode that allows you to paint in finer details with a brush or pen tool.

The app offers a wide range of colors to choose from, allowing you to mix and match to create your own unique shades. You can even save your favorite color combinations for easy access later on.

The Learn Coloring app also features a variety of sketches to color in, ranging from simple shapes to more complex designs. Each sketch comes with helpful tips and instructions, making it easy to learn new techniques and improve your coloring skills.

To help you relax and focus on your coloring, the app includes a variety of instrumental music tracks that are designed to promote relaxation and reduce stress. The music is carefully selected to complement the coloring experience without distracting from it, and you can adjust the volume or turn it off altogether if you prefer.

In addition to the built-in sketches, you can import your own images to color in, making the app a great tool for artists, designers, and educators.

Using the app is easy and intuitive, with simple controls and an undo feature that lets you correct mistakes quickly. Plus, the app tracks your progress over time, allowing you to see how your skills improve with each coloring session.

Whether you're looking to unwind after a long day or just want to explore your creativity in a peaceful environment, the Learn Coloring app is the perfect tool. So why wait? Download the app today and start coloring to the soothing sounds of instrumental music.
