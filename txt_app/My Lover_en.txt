My lover is an app that lets you meet and start up a relationship (either platonic or romantic) with a virtual partner that you can customize however you want. From the options menu, you can choose if you want your virtual companion to be male or female and you can even give them whatever name you want. By default, the male version is named James and the female version is called Ella.

You'll be able to interact a ton with your virtual mate. Thanks to the built-in chat tool, you'll be able to talk about any topic and, depending on what you ask, you'll get one type of answer or another. After all, My lover is basically an AI that you can interact and play with. Different questions will have different answers. Plus, you'll be able to create your own interactions, writing exactly what you want it to respond to different commands.

One of the most important options in My lover is the 'chat content limit.' By adjusting this option you can limit the type of content you can talk about with your virtual partner. This way, with a single touch you'll be able to activate or deactivate conversations with vulgar content. You can also enable or disable voice responses (in case you don't like the voice in your language).

Although the chat tool is probably the best thing about My lover, the app actually offers tons of other features. You can ask it to play music for you and it will do exactly that. You can also check the current temperature. And of course, you can customize the appearance of your virtual partner and change the style of the background.

My lover is an incredibly entertaining app that lets you carry a virtual companion around with you at all times, inside your pocket. You'll be able to talk about hundreds of different topics with James or Ella, chat about anything that interests you, and have as close of a relationship as you want.
