An XML Editor application with XML designer function is a software tool designed for creating, editing, and manipulating XML files. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input XML code, add, delete or modify elements, and format the structure of the document. Additionally, it offers a designer mode where users can design an XML object by an intuitive interface.

The application has two modes of editing: code and designer mode. In code mode, users can directly edit the XML code, either by typing it manually or copying and pasting it from an existing file. Code mode is useful for users who have experience with XML and want to work directly with the markup language.

In designer mode, users can create or edit an XML document using a visual interface that allows them to drag and drop elements, set attributes, and format the structure of the document without having to write the code. Designer mode is ideal for users who are new to XML or prefer a more intuitive interface.

The XML editor application provides an array of features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, validation, and formatting that help users to create well-formed and error-free XML documents. The application also allows users to validate their XML files against a DTD or XSD schema and provides a preview of the final result.

The XML editor's designer mode offers an intuitive interface for creating XML documents. The designer mode typically provides a tree view of the XML document, allowing users to navigate and modify the document structure. Users can select elements from a palette of available elements and drag them onto the document's tree view. The designer mode also allows users to set element attributes and values by filling out a form.

In summary, an XML editor application with a designer function provides users with two modes of editing, code and designer mode, allowing users with varying degrees of expertise to work with XML documents. The XML editor application offers an array of features to make XML document creation, editing, and manipulation more straightforward and more efficient.
