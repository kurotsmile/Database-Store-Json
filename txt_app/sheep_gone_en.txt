Tired of boring barns and endless grass? So is our fluffy little rebel! In Sheep Gone, YOU become the mastermind behind the Great Sheep Escape. Your mission? Help this clever woolly friend break free from the farm, one door at a time!

But don’t think it’s just about opening doors. Oh no, sir! These gates are locked tighter than grandma’s jam jars. You’ll need to push wooden crates onto pressure plates, dodge pesky traps, and slide your way across slippery ice floors — all while keeping your fluffy hooves steady!
